      .l-about-text
        p I love my job! Running a family orthodontic practice is incredibly rewarding. Since 1992, I've had the pleasure of helping men, women and children in Highlands Ranch achieve great smiles. If you ask me, there's nothing quite like a beautiful smile.
        p The motto of my practice is &quot;Our smiles come from the heart.&quot; We treat you like we would treat our own family. 
        p Our practice is not just dedicated to the highest quality of care. It is also committed to providing a comfortable and enjoyable experience to all of our patients. When you walk into our office&mdash;you are welcomed by friends and family. It is something you can look forward to at each appointment. You'll be smiling on the way in, and smiling on the way out. 

        p Life gets busy. We know that your time is incredibly valuable and you can't waste it in a waiting room. That's why our team is constantly working to make sure that our schedule stays on time. Efficiency is a core principle of our practice.

        p As an orthodontist, I am passionate about pursuing ongoing postgraduate education. It is crucial to achieve mastery of the craft. Our approach reflects the work of the best orthodontic practices from around the world.

        p A strong educational background is necessary to decipher what will truly benefit each individual patient. I work to understand every patient, their lifestyle, needs, and expectations. There is no one-size fits all approach. Each person is unique and deserves personalized care. 

        p I've put together an online version of my resume in case you're interested in my educational background. I've also included some photos of my family and me. If you have any questions, please give us a call. We'd love to hear from you.

        p When I first decided to get braces, I was incredibly apprehensive.  I was in my mid-twenties and working for a fashion company.  I had these horrific images of having a mouthful of metal and being in pain.  However, I was also tired of smiling with my mouth closed and being embarrassed about how my teeth looked.  After doing some research, I found Dr. Elliott...

        p I was referred to Dr. Elliott by an oral surgeon for my sleep apnea.  I needed to have jaw surgery to resolve my sleep apnea and Dr. Elliott works very closely with the oral surgeons in the community for TMJ and other jaw and airway issues.  Dr. Elliott is very knowledgeable and I highly recommend him!

        p Dr. Elliott gave my children Amani and Aram beautiful smiles so I did next the logical thing: I had a consultation with Dr. Elliott and got braces for myself. Being a woman of a "certain age" considering braces was a little nerve racking but when Dr. Elliott said he could mount the brackets on the back of my teeth where no one would see them it was a done deal! I love my new smile. Thank you Dr. Elliott and staff!

        p Dr. Elliott came highly recommended by my dentist.  My front teeth overlapped and I had wanted straight front teeth for a long time. Dr. Elliott met with me to discuss options, length of time for treatment, and most importantly asked questions about what was important to me and how I hoped to achieve what I wanted. His entire staff is professional, friendly, and helpful. I would highly recommend Dr. Elliott.

        p My dentist recommended that I be fitted for a bite splint to help reduce the wear and tear that can come from clenching and grinding. Because I had been so pleased with the orthodontic care my daughter received, I approached Dr Elliott about the splint. I had no idea that the impact on my life would be so great! Not only does my jaw feel better and protect my teeth from wear but I am almost headache-free after decades of frequent headaches. I can't say enough about how pleased I am with the outcome and with the terrific care I received by everyone in the practice. Thank you!

          | TMJ is a group of conditions that can cause pain in the jaw, neck, head and face. Many people suffer from these types of symptoms and go to one specialist after another in desperate need of a cure. Suprisingly, TMJ accounts for a large number of these painful symptoms.
        p.s-view-more-paragraph
          | The problem stems from the jaw and the muscles that control jaw movement. Pain is a symptom of TMJ, not the problem itself. Diagnosing and correcting the problem is at the heart of TMJ treatment. If you&apos;re experiencing any of the pain mentioned above and think you might have TMJ, give us a call and we can talk about how we would approach diagnosis and treatment.
